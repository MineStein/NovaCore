{"name":"NovaCore","tagline":"The core for all mini-games on NovaUniverse.","body":"### Welcome to NovaCore.\r\nNovaCore is a project developed by MineStein. It aims to make mini-game development quicker, more efficient, and bug-free. If you wish to contribute to this project, contact MineStein on Skype at: minestein3646.\r\n\r\n### Getting started\r\nTo get started using this awesome development tool, start by adding the following API's to your libraries:\r\n- [BukkitAPI](https://dl.bukkit.org/downloads/bukkit/)\r\n- [BarAPI](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/bar-api/)\r\n\r\nOnce you have these two installed, you are ready to begin! Create your main class (don't name it \"Core\"!). This classes' parent will not be JavaPlugin, instead it will be Core from the com.minestein.novacore package.\r\n\r\nThis is what it should look (somewhat) like:\r\n\r\n``` java\r\n public class Main extends Core {\r\n     @Override\r\n     public void onLoad() {\r\n\r\n     }\r\n     @Override\r\n     public void onEnable() {\r\n\r\n     }\r\n }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen inside of your plugin.yml file, add the following:\r\n```yaml\r\ndepend: [NovaCore]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Some Basics\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    setPrefix(String);\r\n    setSoftPrefix(String);\r\n    setDefaultScoreboardEnabled(Boolean);\r\n```\r\n\r\n_**NOTE: You must set these three in the onLoad for them to work properly!**_\r\n\r\nsetPrefix and setSoftPrefix are used to change the overall feel of messages from the server. The ordinary prefix is the one with brackets around it. For example: \"[ExampleGame]\". The soft prefix is used in the scoreboard (if the default one is enabled) and bar messages. It is the one in random colors without the brackets. For example: \"ExampleGame\".\r\n\r\nsetDefaultScoreboardEnabled will tell whether or not the server uses the default side scoreboard in NovaCore. This includes a nice rainbow interface using the soft prefix with a random color code from the valid colors as the objective.\r\n\r\nBe sure to play around with this project!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
